Simple implementantion (or just workaround) of Android's [Html.ImageGetter](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/Html.ImageGetter.html) for asynchronous (non-blocking) image loading
using the [Html.fromHtml](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/Html.html#fromHtml%28java.lang.String,%20android.text.Html.ImageGetter,%20android.text.Html.TagHandler%29) method, developed with the intention for using it in ListViews.
